Stock Prediction Software (Uptick):
•	Applying sentiment analysis on low volitilty stock’s relevant news articles and tweets to predicts possible trends and future price changes
•	Using legacy stock data, sentiment analysis on news articles and tweets, and machine learning

Currently we have scrapped the web for legacy stock data, news articles, and tweets. And we have been able to apply sentiment
analysis on news articles and tweets in order to find the negativety and/or positivey of media data/text.

My lead roles have been in accessing the twitter api in order to scrape tweets based on username(@) or hashtag(#).
I also created a sentiment analysis script to apply sentiment analysis accurently on news atricles and tweets. 

Then next steps are to learn the best way to apply machine learning onto all of the data that we have collected.
